# Node Server Unit Testing Mobiquity Practices
This repo contains a server written in JavaScript for
running on the node.js platform.

This functions as a teaching tool, so it is heavily
commented. If you are updating the code, be sure to update
explanations in the comments as well and provide comments
for new code.

## Installation

Install nodejs and npm. I recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
or [`asdf`](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf) for managing
node version installations, but feel free to install it
from source or use a package manager like `brew`.

Once nodejs is installed, run `npm install` to install the
dependencies for the projects. Now you're ready to start
testing.

Once installation is complete, you can run `npm start` to
start the development server. This will link you to the
two apps which are running in the frontend.

Testing is done with the `npm test` command.
